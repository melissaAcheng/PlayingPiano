# PlayingPiano

The Playing Piano is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript following Ania Kub√≥w's tutorial: https://youtu.be/mjmh093Sucg.

I made the following changes:
- corrected the layout of black and white keys (alternating 2 and 3 black keys)
- matched the correct pitch with each key

Features to add:
- key lights up when pressed
- make the keyboard responsive to the window size
